          <h2>Project overview</h2>
          <p>
            Mobile UX design is the design of user experiences for hand-held and wearable devices. Designers create solutions (typically applications) to meet mobile users' unique requirements and restrictions. Designers focus on accessibility, discoverability and efficiency to optimize on-the-go interactive experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            User Interface (UI) determines how the app will look like, while UX determines what problem it will solve in the users' life. UI is revolves around visually directing the user about the app interface, while UX includes researching, testing, developing the app.

          <h2>Project results</h2>
          <p>
            The UI/UX design of software and applications helps improve customer experience and satisfaction. This ultimately helps increase the number of people using your product. If users encounter roadblocks when trying to complete actions on your product, they are very likely to drop off.
